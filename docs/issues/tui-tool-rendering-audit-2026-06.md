# TUI Tool Rendering Audit — June 2026

## Purpose

This note is the canonical TUI rendering roadmap for tools.

It exists to answer four questions consistently:

1. Which tools should appear in the chat transcript?
2. If they appear, should they render full output, compact output, or metadata only?
3. Which tools should update another UI surface instead of creating a normal tool bubble?
4. Which legacy TUI tool names are no longer part of the real runtime surface?

The canonical runtime sources are:

- `internal/tools/builtin/builtin.go`
- `pkg/sdk/client.go`

`internal/nexustui/agent/tools/tool_names.go` is not canonical anymore. It is a partial, legacy TUI vocabulary and must not be used as the source of truth for future renderer work.

## Legend

- `Done`: implemented and already validated in the TUI
- `Planned`: desired target state
- `Open`: direction identified, but product detail still needs confirmation
- `Chat policy` values:
  - `hidden`: no normal tool bubble in transcript
  - `meta`: show only a small metadata summary, not the raw payload
  - `compact`: show a visible but condensed transcript item
  - `full`: show a richer transcript item with existing truncation / expand behavior
  - `generic`: fallback renderer is acceptable for now
- `Surface` values:
  - `chat`
  - `header`
  - `sidebar`
  - `modal`
  - `artifact`
  - `workspace chrome`

## Confirmed Decisions Already Done

- [x] Tool result bubbles are slightly narrower than assistant and user messages.
- [x] `read_file` is now `meta` in chat instead of dumping file contents inline.
- [x] Normal truncation behavior stays enabled for write/edit style outputs; the transcript is not globally forced into wrapping mode.
- [x] The tool-ordering streaming fix is compatible with this roadmap: tool items stay inline, but post-tool assistant synthesis now lands in the correct place.
- [x] `enter_plan_mode` and `exit_plan_mode` are now hidden from the chat transcript, and the header reflects the real execution mode (`execute` / `plan` / `pair`).

## Cross-Cutting Product Rules

- Read-heavy tools should not dump large payloads into the main transcript by default.
- Write and mutation tools are important execution evidence and should usually stay visible in chat.
- System-state tools should update dedicated UI surfaces instead of looking like normal user-facing tool calls.
- Generic rendering is acceptable as a temporary fallback, but only when the tool is low-frequency or low-value in the transcript.
- The next renderer passes should follow this order:
  1. system surfaces that should hide tool bubbles entirely
  2. task tools
  3. multi-agent tools
  4. remaining read/list/search compaction
  5. long-tail generic cleanup

## Category A — Hidden From Chat, Represented Elsewhere

These tools should not produce normal transcript tool items. Their effect should be visible through dedicated UI state.

| Tool(s) | Surface | State | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `enter_plan_mode`, `exit_plan_mode` | `header` | Done | Hidden from the transcript. The header mode badge now follows the real execution mode (`execute` / `plan` / `pair`). |
| `submit_plan` | `artifact`, `header` | Planned | Prefer plan artifact / review state over a normal tool bubble. |
| `task_create`, `task_update` | `sidebar` | Done | Hidden from transcript. Session-scoped task state is persisted and rendered in the sidebar task section. |
| `task_list`, `task_get`, `task_stop` | `chat`, `sidebar` | Planned | Keep visible as compact/meta inspection or control tools in chat while the sidebar remains the source of truth for session tasks. |
| `enter_worktree`, `exit_worktree` | `header`, `workspace chrome` | Planned | Should update displayed workspace root / worktree state, not clutter chat. |
| `request_permissions` | `modal` | Planned | Permission request already has dedicated UX; transcript bubble should not be primary. |

### `submit_plan` long-term roadmap

The `submit_plan` flow is intentionally more complex than the other hidden tools and should be treated as a dedicated review surface, not a normal chat item.

Long-term product objective:

- `submit_plan` becomes a full plan-review workflow, separate from the normal transcript
- the user can read the submitted markdown cleanly, review it, annotate it, request revisions, and approve it without chat noise
- the system preserves plan history across revisions
- approval remains distinct from execution: after approval the agent still exits plan mode explicitly and then creates `task_*` items

#### V1 — first implementation target

Scope locked for implementation:

- no normal transcript bubble for `submit_plan`
- opens a dedicated review surface, close to permission review but document-oriented
- primary content is the submitted markdown plan, rendered read-only with visible line numbers
- supports line-attached comments on a single line
- supports an additional global review comment
- review actions are `Approve` and `Request changes`
- `Request changes` returns structured review data, not just a free-form chat message
- version history is preserved, with the latest version as the main focus
- approval does not execute directly; after approval the agent remains responsible for calling `exit_plan_mode` and then creating `task_*` items

Explicit non-goals for V1:

- multi-line range comments
- full visual diff review between plan versions
- direct plan execution from the review surface

#### V2 — richer review workflow

Desired additions after V1 is stable:

- better version browsing between plan submissions
- side-by-side or inline revision awareness between versions
- comment management improvements such as resolved / unresolved state
- clearer review timeline showing submit, feedback, resubmit, approval
- stronger linking between comments and the next submitted revision

#### V3 — full document-review surface

Longer-term target if the plan workflow proves central:

- multi-line range comments and richer document anchoring
- more advanced review interactions closer to code-review / doc-review tools
- stronger artifact-centric navigation between plan, comments, approval state, and resulting tasks
- potential tighter integration with sidebar/system surfaces so plan review, approval, and task kickoff feel like one continuous workflow

Implementation note:

- this should reuse the permission-style interaction model where useful, but the document viewer, line targeting, review payload, and version handling are plan-specific
- we should implement V1 first and treat V2/V3 as roadmap, not as hidden scope inside the first pass

### Sidebar direction for tasks

Current product direction, still open in detail:

- sidebar opens automatically on first task mutation
- sidebar can also be opened manually later
- sidebar baseline should include workspace path and session info
- task area at the bottom should visually replace the old todo concept
- likely statuses:
  - completed: checked
  - in progress: active / pending marker
  - pending: empty box or equivalent

Open product question:

- keep a brand new task visual language, or intentionally reuse the current todo representation with updated semantics


### `task_*` long-term roadmap

Long-term product objective:

- `task_*` becomes the canonical execution-tracking surface for mono-run work
- the old transcript-centered `todos` mental model is retired
- the main transcript stays focused on user intent, assistant synthesis, and important execution evidence, while task state lives primarily in the sidebar
- tasks are session-scoped, persist across reload, and survive resume cleanly
- tasks can later connect plan approval, execution progress, and background/runtime work in one continuous system surface

Current technical constraints to design around:

- the current `TaskStore` in `internal/tools/task/store.go` is an in-memory global store
- it is not session-scoped yet
- it is not persisted yet
- `task_list` currently mixes two concepts: background runtime tasks and todo-style planning tasks
- the current sidebar has no task section yet; it only renders session/model/files/LSP/MCP/skills

Design principles:

- task state should be represented once, in one canonical UI surface
- `task_create` and `task_update` should not spam the transcript once the sidebar task surface exists
- task status should be readable at a glance without opening tool details
- the active task should be obvious from both the sidebar and compact header/pill state
- background processes and planning tasks are related but not identical; the UI should distinguish them cleanly
- the first implementation should reuse the strongest current `todos` UX ideas rather than inventing a second parallel visual language

#### V1 — replace `todos` with a session task section in the sidebar

Scope locked for first implementation:

- hide `task_create` and `task_update` from the normal transcript
- add a new task section at the bottom of the sidebar
- auto-open or auto-expand the sidebar task section on the first task mutation of the session
- reuse the current checklist semantics from `todos`:
  - pending: empty box
  - in progress: spinner / active marker
  - completed: checkmark
- primary row text is the task `subject`
- secondary/active text uses `activeForm` when a task is `in_progress`
- show compact progress summary above the list, for example `2/5 completed` plus the active task label when relevant
- keep `task_list`, `task_get`, and `task_stop` visible in chat only as compact/meta fallback items for now
- no user editing from the sidebar in V1; it is a system state display only

V1 technical requirements:

- make task state session-scoped instead of process-global
- persist task state so reload/resume restores the sidebar accurately
- create a workspace-to-UI update path for task mutations, similar in spirit to plan review and permission surfaces
- define a canonical sort order:
  - in progress first
  - pending next
  - completed last
- preserve stable ordering for tasks created from an approved plan

#### V2 — unify planning tasks and background tasks under one task surface

Desired additions after V1 is stable:

- merge the sidebar task section with runtime/background execution visibility where it makes product sense
- expose task dependencies visually when `blocks` / `blockedBy` are present
- support grouped states such as:
  - ready
  - blocked
  - running
  - completed
- allow the user to inspect one selected task in a right-side details pane or sidebar subview
- show task metadata that matters operationally:
  - owner
  - timestamps
  - blocking relationships
  - relevant runtime output links when applicable
- define whether `task_list(listType=background|todo|all)` remains a tool-first concept or becomes mostly an internal/system surface

#### V3 — task-centric execution workspace

Longer-term target if the task flow becomes central:

- tasks become the execution backbone after `submit_plan` approval
- approved plan steps map cleanly into created tasks with stable ordering and maybe plan-step references in metadata
- selecting a task can filter or highlight the related transcript/tool activity
- task state can drive automation around execution sequencing, verification, or delegation
- future multi-agent work can attach ownership/status directly to tasks rather than inventing a parallel progress surface

Implementation order for the task work itself:

1. define the canonical session-scoped task state model and persistence shape
2. add runtime eventing or equivalent workspace notifications for `task_create` / `task_update` / deletion
3. add the sidebar task section with V1 visual language
4. hide `task_create` and `task_update` from the transcript once the sidebar state is trustworthy
5. decide the final role of `task_list`, `task_get`, and `task_stop`
6. only after that, remove the remaining legacy `todos` transcript behavior

Recommended visual language:

- do not invent a radically new style first
- reuse the current `todos` strengths:
  - concise progress ratio
  - strong active-task wording
  - checklist rows with clear status icons
- adapt them to the sidebar layout rather than the transcript bubble layout
- keep the task section denser than chat content, because it is operational state, not prose

## Category B — Metadata Only In Chat

These tools should remain visible in the transcript, but only as summaries. The raw payload is too noisy for normal chat flow.

| Tool(s) | Surface | State | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `read_file` | `chat` | Done | Show file path plus line-range / partial-read metadata; hide file contents inline. |
| `read_document_url` | `chat` | Planned | Same philosophy as `read_file`: source URL + conversion/read summary, not full extracted body. |
| `get_file_metadata` | `chat` | Planned | Keep size, type, timestamps, permissions; no verbose JSON dump. |
| `browser_snapshot`, `browser_extract` | `chat` | Planned | Summarize what was captured and from which page; hide large extraction bodies by default. |
| `browser_network_list`, `browser_list_downloads`, `browser_list_pages`, `browser_search_content` | `chat` | Planned | Show counts, active page, matched items, and key identifiers only. |
| `list_agents` | `chat` | Planned | If it stays in chat at all, render agent count and brief status summaries instead of raw payload. |
| `get_goal` | `chat` | Planned | Goal state is useful, but raw structure should collapse into a concise status card. |
| `nexus_read_skill` | `chat` | Planned | Skill content can be large; show which skill was read and a concise summary instead of the full body. |
| `memory_search_nodes`, `memory_open_nodes` | `chat` | Planned | Show match counts / node IDs / short titles, not full memory payloads. |

## Category C — Compact Chat Items

These tools should stay visible in chat, but the transcript item should be intentionally condensed.

| Tool(s) | Surface | State | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `list_directory` | `chat` | Open | Candidate compact treatment: path, item count, maybe first few entries. Full raw listing probably too noisy. |
| `glob` | `chat` | Planned | Compact summary with pattern, root path, match count, optional short preview. |
| `grep` | `chat` | Planned | Compact summary with pattern, file count, hit count, and a few top matches. |
| `web_search` | `chat` | Planned | Keep the search visible, but prefer query + result count + top hits over raw payload. |
| `web_fetch` | `chat` | Planned | Show URL, status, content type, and maybe short snippet; do not flood transcript. |
| `browser_open`, `browser_navigate`, `browser_select_page`, `browser_close_page` | `chat` | Planned | Navigation state changes are useful, but should be one-line or near one-line items. |
| `browser_click`, `browser_type`, `browser_press`, `browser_scroll`, `browser_wait` | `chat` | Planned | Compact action log, not full dumps. |
| `close_agent`, `wait_agent`, `send_agent_message` | `chat` | Planned | Compact event-style rendering unless a richer multi-agent panel supersedes it. |
| `create_goal`, `update_goal` | `chat` | Planned | Good candidates for compact state transition cards. |
| `nexus_list_skills`, `nexus_validate_skill`, `tool_search` | `chat` | Planned | Compact count/result rendering is enough. |
| `mcp` | `chat` | Planned | Keep visible but summarized by operation, target server, and success/failure. |
| `rag_search`, `rag_ingest` | `chat` | Planned | Compact counts and identifiers, not large result bodies. |
| `memory_create_entities`, `memory_add_observations` | `chat` | Planned | Summarize created / updated node counts and names. |

## Category D — Rich Chat Rendering With Normal Truncation

These tools are meaningful execution steps and should stay visibly represented as richer transcript items.

| Tool(s) | Surface | State | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `bash` | `chat` | Planned | Keep rich renderer. Important for execution auditability. |
| `write_stdin` | `chat` | Planned | Treat as a compact or rich shell continuation event under the shell family. |
| `job_output`, `job_kill` | `chat` | Planned | Already shell-adjacent; keep visible. |
| `write_file`, `edit_file`, `apply_patch`, `notebook_edit` | `chat` | Planned | Keep diff-oriented rendering with current truncation/expand behavior. |
| `create_directory`, `remove_file` | `chat` | Planned | Mutation events should remain explicit in chat. |
| `docx` | `chat` | Planned | File-generation style tool; visible result is useful. |
| `agent`, `spawn_agent`, `resume_agent` | `chat` | Planned | Multi-agent orchestration deserves dedicated rendering, not generic JSON blobs. |
| `generate_image`, `tts`, `stt`, `code_complete` | `chat` | Planned | Result is user-visible and worth a richer item, even if renderer stays simple at first. |
| `lsp` | `chat` | Planned | The generic LSP payload is too vague today; needs a proper status/result renderer. |
| `monitor` | `chat` | Planned | Should read as a tracked background-execution item, close to shell/task UX. |
| `ask_user_question` | `chat` | Planned | User-facing question flow deserves dedicated rich UX: explicit prompt, choice list, and free-form answer path. |

## Category E — Generic For Now, Revisit Later

These tools can remain generic temporarily without blocking the UX cleanup.

| Tool(s) | Surface | State | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `browser_get_network_policy`, `browser_set_network_policy` | `chat` | Planned | Low-frequency; generic is acceptable until the browser family gets a unified renderer pass. |
| `browser_screenshot` | `chat` | Planned | Could later show thumbnail / artifact metadata, but generic is acceptable short-term. |
| `skill` | `chat` | Planned | Depends on how much of skill execution should be surfaced as system state vs transcript content. |

## Not On The Active Canonical Runtime Surface

These names still appear in legacy TUI code or config, but they are not part of the canonical runtime registry described above.

| Legacy name | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `todos` | Legacy | Old transcript/task concept. Should be replaced by the `task_*` family and sidebar work. |
| `multi_edit` | Legacy | TUI still has a renderer, but canonical runtime centers on `apply_patch`, `edit_file`, and `write_file`. |
| `download` | Legacy | Not part of the current builtin registry. |
| `fetch` | Legacy | Superseded by `web_fetch` and `read_document_url` depending on intent. |
| `agentic_fetch` | Legacy | Not part of the current builtin registry. |
| `sourcegraph` | Legacy | Not part of the current builtin registry. |
| `task_output` | Deprecated / inactive | Defined in `internal/tools/task/constants.go`, but not registered in the active builtin runtime surface. Prefer file reads on task outputs instead. |


## Legacy Candidate Audit Before Any Revival

I did not find a local `crush` repository near this workspace. For now, the closest reliable references are:

- the existing legacy TUI renderers in `internal/nexustui/ui/chat/`
- the current structured tool blocks in `../nexus-ui/src/renderer/components/chat/`

That is enough to make tool-by-tool decisions without reintroducing old names blindly.

| Legacy tool | What the old UI already does well | Recommendation for Nexus |
|---|---|---|
| `multi_edit` | Full-width diff rendering, file-focused header, failed-edit handling. | Do not revive the legacy name. Keep the renderer ideas and fold them into canonical mutation flows such as `apply_patch` or any future batch-edit surface. |
| `download` | Shows URL, optional destination path, timeout, and result body. | Do not revive by default. Only bring back a dedicated UX if downloaded artifacts become an intentional product surface rather than an implementation detail. |
| `fetch` | Syntax-highlighted body by format (`text`, `html`, markdown fallback). | Do not revive the legacy name. Reuse the useful parts for `web_fetch` and `read_document_url`, which are the current canonical read/fetch surfaces. |
| `agentic_fetch` | Best legacy pattern in the set: prompt tag plus nested tool tree and final synthesized body. | Keep as a strong design reference, but apply it to canonical orchestration surfaces such as `agent`, `spawn_agent`, `resume_agent`, or future sub-run containers instead of restoring `agentic_fetch` itself. |
| `sourcegraph` | Query + count/context header with plain result body. | Only worth reviving if Nexus intentionally reintroduces an external code-search backend. If that happens, prefer a compact search-family renderer over a legacy-specific special case. |
| `todos` | Strong visual language: ratio header, progress/change summary, checklist body, started/completed feedback. | Preserve these UX ideas, but migrate them into the upcoming task sidebar and `task_*` visual system rather than keeping todo transcript bubbles alive. |

### Extra note from `nexus-ui`

`nexus-ui` already confirms two product directions that match this audit:

- `ask_user_question` is treated as a dedicated rich interaction, not a generic block
- `task_create` / `task_update` / `task_list` already have dedicated rendering, which supports moving further toward a system-managed task surface

This means we should treat the legacy TUI renderers as a pattern library, not as a registry to restore.

## Recommended Execution Order

1. Hide system-state tools from chat and wire them to header / sidebar / modal surfaces.
2. Decide the final task sidebar UX and migrate `task_*` away from the old `todos` mental model.
3. Add dedicated multi-agent renderers for `agent`, `spawn_agent`, `resume_agent`, `wait_agent`, `send_agent_message`, `close_agent`, and `list_agents`.
4. Convert read/list/search families to summary-first rendering.
5. Remove or quarantine legacy TUI-only tool names so the renderer map tracks the canonical runtime surface again.
